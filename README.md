# Build-Store-Front-Backend-API
We will Build a JavaScript API based on a requirements given by the stakeholders. We will architect the database, tables, and columns to fulfill the requirements. We will create a RESTful API to be accessible to the frontend developers. We will also have write tests, secure user information with encryption, and provide tokens for integration into the frontend.
